## Data Sources

This project uses data derived from the Building Data Genome project.

- The full source repository is cloned locally under
  `the-building-data-genome-project/` for reference.
- It is intentionally excluded from version control.
- Curated CSVs for 3 buildings (~1.2 MB each) are included under `data/`
  so collaborators can clone and run the project immediately.
